# DEPRECATED: This file is no longer used.

# System prompts are now hardcoded in lib/utils.zsh for the JSON response format.
# User customization of system prompts has been disabled to ensure consistent
# JSON output and safety checks.
#
# You can still configure:
# - ZSH_AI_LANG: Response language (EN, KO, JA, ZH, DE, FR, ES) in .env
# - ZSH_AI_PROVIDER: AI provider (anthropic, openai, gemini, ollama) in .env
# - Other settings: See .env.example
